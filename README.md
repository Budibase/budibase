## ✨ Features

### Build and ship real software 
Unlike other platforms, with Budibase you build and ship single page applications. Budibase applications have performance baked in and can be designed responsively, providing users with a great experience.
<br /><br />

### Open source and extensible
Budibase is open-source - licensed as GPL v3. This should fill you with confidence that Budibase will always be around. You can also code against Budibase or fork it and make changes as you please, providing a developer-friendly experience.
<br /><br />

### Load data or start from scratch
Budibase pulls data from multiple sources, including MongoDB, CouchDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, Airtable, S3, DynamoDB, or a REST API. And unlike other platforms, with Budibase you can start from scratch and create business apps with no data sources. [Request new datasources](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas).

<br /><br />

### Design and build apps with powerful pre-made components

Budibase comes out of the box with beautifully designed, powerful components which you can use like building blocks to build your UI. We also expose many of your favourite CSS styling options so you can go that extra creative mile. [Request new component](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas).

### Deploy with confidence and security
Budibase is made to scale. With Budibase, you can self-host on your own infrastructure and globally manage users, onboarding, SMTP, apps, groups, theming and more. You can also provide users/groups with an app portal and disseminate user management to the group manager.

## Budibase Public API
As with anything that we build in Budibase, our new public API is simple to use, flexible, and introduces new extensibility. To summarize, the Budibase API enables:

- Budibase as a backend
- Interoperability


#### Docs
You can learn more about the Budibase API at the following places:

- [General documentation](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/public-api): Learn how to get your API key, how to use spec, and how to use Postman
- [Interactive API documentation](https://docs.budibase.com/reference/appcreate) : Learn how to interact with the API

<br /><br />

### How the repository is organized
Budibase is a monorepo managed by lerna. Lerna manages the building and publishing of the budibase packages. At a high level, here are the packages that make up Budibase.

- [packages/builder](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/tree/HEAD/packages/builder) - contains code for the budibase builder client-side svelte application.

- [packages/client](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/tree/HEAD/packages/client) - A module that runs in the browser responsible for reading JSON definition and creating living, breathing web apps from it.

- [packages/server](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/tree/HEAD/packages/server) - The budibase server. This Koa app is responsible for serving the JS for the builder and budibase apps, as well as providing the API for interaction with the database and file system.
