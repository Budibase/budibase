The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas.

Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, ExampleCompany.com). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. Important: Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces.

With a public NAT gateway, internet-bound traffic from a private subnet can be routed to the NAT gateway, so that instances in a private subnet can connect to the internet. With a private NAT gateway, private communication is routed across VPCs and on-premises networks through a transit gateway or virtual private gateway. Common use cases include running large workloads behind a small pool of allowlisted IPv4 addresses, preserving private IPv4 addresses, and communicating between overlapping networks. For more information, see NAT gateways in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.

The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions. If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results. If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the OwnerIds option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the Amazon Web Services account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for snapshots owned by Amazon, or self for snapshots that you own. If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Amazon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), self for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or all for public snapshots. If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The MaxResults parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page.

   * Describes the specified EBS snapshots available to you or all of the EBS snapshots available to you. The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts for which you have explicit create volume permissions. The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:    public: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the all group. All Amazon Web Services accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.    explicit: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific Amazon Web Services account.    implicit: An Amazon Web Services account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.   The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions. If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results. If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the OwnerIds option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the Amazon Web Services account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for snapshots owned by Amazon, or self for snapshots that you own. If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Amazon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), self for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or all for public snapshots. If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable.

   * Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions. You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply:   [EC2-VPC] If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request.   [EC2-Classic] If don't specify an Availability Zone, we choose one for you.   Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails. For more information, see Instance types available only in a VPC.   [EC2-VPC] All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet.   Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more information, see Instance types.   If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security group. For more information, see Security groups.   If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails.   You can create a launch template, which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using RunInstances, you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters. To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances. An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the running state. You can check the state of your instance using DescribeInstances. You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see CreateTags and Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources. Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see Key pairs. For troubleshooting, see What to do if an instance immediately terminates, and Troubleshooting connecting to your instance.

The options include:    open - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.    targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation.
