  /**
   * Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler strategies available:    REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.    DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.   You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an UpdateService operation. The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service is using either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used, although they're currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the CreateTaskSet operation. For more information, see Amazon ECS Deployment Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the placementStrategy parameter):   Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.

   * Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance. Once a container instance has reached an ACTIVE state, you can change the status of a container instance to DRAINING to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.  A container instance cannot be changed to DRAINING until it has reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received.  When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using UpdateService.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.   Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks. When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

   * Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance. Once a container instance has reached an ACTIVE state, you can change the status of a container instance to DRAINING to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.  A container instance cannot be changed to DRAINING until it has reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received.  When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using UpdateService.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.   Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks. When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

   *  Updating the task placement strategies and constraints on an Amazon ECS service remains in preview and is a Beta Service as defined by and subject to the Beta Service Participation Service Terms located at https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms ("Beta Terms"). These Beta Terms apply to your participation in this preview.  Modifies the parameters of a service. For services using the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller, the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, or task definition used can be updated. For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, a new CodeDeploy deployment should be created. For more information, see CreateDeployment in the CodeDeploy API Reference. For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, you should create a new task set. For more information, see CreateTaskSet. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.  If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.  You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).   When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout, after which SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy):   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.     When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:    Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.

     * The number of cpu units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run. This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level cpu value.  You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the Amazon EC2 Instances detail page by 1,024.  Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see CPU share constraint in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:    Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.    Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.   On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that is described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as 0, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.

If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed.

This parameter maps to MemoryReservation in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory-reservation option to docker run. If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in a container definition. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of memory is used. For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a memoryReservation of 128 MiB, and a memory hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when needed.

The service-linked role is required for services that make use of multiple target groups. For more information, see Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY and associates one target group with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it.

If you are using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service.

Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance, because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.

If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode.

If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity.

New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.
