    /**
     * Sets the desired offset of a token.
     *
     * This uses a line-based offset collapsing behavior to handle tokens on the same line.
     * For example, consider the following two cases:
     *
     * (
     *     [
     *         bar
     *     ]
     * )
     *
     * ([
     *     bar
     * ])
     *
     * Based on the first case, it's clear that the `bar` token needs to have an offset of 1 indent level (4 spaces) from
     * the `[` token, and the `[` token has to have an offset of 1 indent level from the `(` token. Since the `(` token is
     * the first on its line (with an indent of 0 spaces), the `bar` token needs to be offset by 2 indent levels (8 spaces)
     * from the start of its line.
     *
     * However, in the second case `bar` should only be indented by 4 spaces. This is because the offset of 1 indent level
     * between the `(` and the `[` tokens gets "collapsed" because the two tokens are on the same line. As a result, the
     * `(` token is mapped to the `[` token with an offset of 0, and the rule correctly decides that `bar` should be indented
     * by 1 indent level from the start of the line.
     *
     * This is useful because rule listeners can usually just call `setDesiredOffset` for all the tokens in the node,
     * without needing to check which lines those tokens are on.
     *
     * Note that since collapsing only occurs when two tokens are on the same line, there are a few cases where non-intuitive
     * behavior can occur. For example, consider the following cases:
     *
     * foo(
     * ).
     *     bar(
     *         baz
     *     )
     *
     * foo(
     * ).bar(
     *     baz
     * )
     *
     * Based on the first example, it would seem that `bar` should be offset by 1 indent level from `foo`, and `baz`
     * should be offset by 1 indent level from `bar`. However, this is not correct, because it would result in `baz`
     * being indented by 2 indent levels in the second case (since `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` are all on separate lines, no
     * collapsing would occur).
     *
     * Instead, the correct way would be to offset `baz` by 1 level from `bar`, offset `bar` by 1 level from the `)`, and
     * offset the `)` by 0 levels from `foo`. This ensures that the offset between `bar` and the `)` are correctly collapsed
     * in the second case.
     *
     * @param token The token
     * @param fromToken The token that `token` should be offset from
     * @param offset The desired indent level

    /**
     * Sets the desired offset of all tokens in a range
     * It's common for node listeners in this file to need to apply the same offset to a large, contiguous range of tokens.
     * Moreover, the offset of any given token is usually updated multiple times (roughly once for each node that contains
     * it). This means that the offset of each token is updated O(AST depth) times.
     * It would not be performant to store and update the offsets for each token independently, because the rule would end
     * up having a time complexity of O(number of tokens * AST depth), which is quite slow for large files.
     *
     * Instead, the offset tree is represented as a collection of contiguous offset ranges in a file. For example, the following
     * list could represent the state of the offset tree at a given point:
     *
     * * Tokens starting in the interval [0, 15) are aligned with the beginning of the file
     * * Tokens starting in the interval [15, 30) are offset by 1 indent level from the `bar` token
     * * Tokens starting in the interval [30, 43) are offset by 1 indent level from the `foo` token
     * * Tokens starting in the interval [43, 820) are offset by 2 indent levels from the `bar` token
     * * Tokens starting in the interval [820, âˆž) are offset by 1 indent level from the `baz` token
     *
     * The `setDesiredOffsets` methods inserts ranges like the ones above. The third line above would be inserted by using:
     * `setDesiredOffsets([30, 43], fooToken, 1);`
     *
     * @param range A [start, end] pair. All tokens with range[0] <= token.start < range[1] will have the offset applied.
     * @param fromToken The token that this is offset from
     * @param offset The desired indent level
     * @param force `true` if this offset should not use the normal collapsing behavior. This should almost always be false.
