## v3.0.0 2017-01-31

-   Initial version of Nodemailer 3

This update brings a lot of breaking changes:

-   License changed from MIT to **EUPL-1.1**. This was possible as the new version of Nodemailer is a major rewrite. The features I don't have ownership for, were removed or reimplemented. If there's still some snippets in the code that have vague ownership then notify <mailto:andris@kreata.ee> about the conflicting code and I'll fix it.
-   Requires **Node.js v6+**
-   All **templating is gone**. It was too confusing to use and to be really universal a huge list of different renderers would be required. Nodemailer is about email, not about parsing different template syntaxes
-   **No NTLM authentication**. It was too difficult to re-implement. If you still need it then it would be possible to introduce a pluggable SASL interface where you could load the NTLM module in your own code and pass it to Nodemailer. Currently this is not possible.
-   **OAuth2 authentication** is built in and has a different [configuration](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/). You can use both user (3LO) and service (2LO) accounts to generate access tokens from Nodemailer. Additionally there's a new feature to authenticate differently for every message – useful if your application sends on behalf of different users instead of a single sender.
-   **Improved Calendaring**. Provide an ical file to Nodemailer to send out [calendar events](https://nodemailer.com/message/calendar-events/).

And also some non-breaking changes:

-   All **dependencies were dropped**. There is exactly 0 dependencies needed to use Nodemailer. This brings the installation time of Nodemailer from NPM down to less than 2 seconds
-   **Delivery status notifications** added to Nodemailer
-   Improved and built-in **DKIM** signing of messages. Previously you needed an external module for this and it did quite a lousy job with larger messages
-   **Stream transport** to return a RFC822 formatted message as a stream. Useful if you want to use Nodemailer as a preprocessor and not for actual delivery.
-   **Sendmail** transport built-in, no need for external transport plugin

See [Nodemailer.com](https://nodemailer.com/) for full documentation

## 2.1.0 2016-02-01
