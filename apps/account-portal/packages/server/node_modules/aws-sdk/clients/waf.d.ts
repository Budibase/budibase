The RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the RateLimit. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request not only must exceed the RateLimit, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32    A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a RateBasedRule:   A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI    A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH    A TargetString of login    Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. By adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site.

Where to look, such as at the beginning or the end of a query string.   Whether to perform any conversions on the request, such as converting it to lowercase, before inspecting it for the specified string.   For example, you can add a ByteMatchSetUpdate object that matches web requests in which User-Agent headers contain the string BadBot. You can then configure AWS WAF to block those requests. To create and configure a ByteMatchSet, perform the following steps:   Create a ByteMatchSet. For more information, see CreateByteMatchSet.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateByteMatchSet request.   Submit an UpdateByteMatchSet request to specify the part of the request that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.

Note that transformations of the request body are not supported because the AWS resource forwards only the first 8192 bytes of your request to AWS WAF. You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.   A ComparisonOperator used for evaluating the selected part of the request against the specified Size, such as equals, greater than, less than, and so on.   The length, in bytes, that you want AWS WAF to watch for in selected part of the request. The length is computed after applying the transformation.   For example, you can add a SizeConstraintSetUpdate object that matches web requests in which the length of the User-Agent header is greater than 100 bytes. You can then configure AWS WAF to block those requests. To create and configure a SizeConstraintSet, perform the following steps:   Create a SizeConstraintSet. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request.   Submit an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request to specify the part of the request that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.
