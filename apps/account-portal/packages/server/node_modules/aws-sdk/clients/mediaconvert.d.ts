For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn't have moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes' faces, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable temporal adaptive quantization, adjust the strength of the filter with the setting Adaptive quantization.
