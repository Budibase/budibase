The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event. The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:  Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks might still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see Monitor the status of your volumes in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.  Actions: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency. Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

Similar to the state-reason-code filter.    requester-id - The ID of the entity that launched the instance on your behalf (for example, Amazon Web Services Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).    reservation-id - The ID of the instance's reservation. A reservation ID is created any time you launch an instance. A reservation ID has a one-to-one relationship with an instance launch request, but can be associated with more than one instance if you launch multiple instances using the same launch request. For example, if you launch one instance, you get one reservation ID. If you launch ten instances using the same launch request, you also get one reservation ID.    root-device-name - The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1).    root-device-type - The type of the root device volume (ebs | instance-store).    source-dest-check - Indicates whether the instance performs source/destination checking. A value of true means that checking is enabled, and false means that checking is disabled. The value must be false for the instance to perform network address translation (NAT) in your VPC.     spot-instance-request-id - The ID of the Spot Instance request.    state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.    state-reason-message - A message that describes the state change.    subnet-id - The ID of the subnet for the instance.    tag:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources that have a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.    tenancy - The tenancy of an instance (dedicated | default | host).    tpm-support - Indicates if the instance is configured for NitroTPM support (v2.0).     usage-operation - The usage operation value for the instance (RunInstances | RunInstances:00g0 | RunInstances:0010 | RunInstances:1010 | RunInstances:1014 | RunInstances:1110 | RunInstances:0014 | RunInstances:0210 | RunInstances:0110 | RunInstances:0100 | RunInstances:0004 | RunInstances:0200 | RunInstances:000g | RunInstances:0g00 | RunInstances:0002 | RunInstances:0800 | RunInstances:0102 | RunInstances:0006 | RunInstances:0202).    usage-operation-update-time - The time that the usage operation was last updated, for example, 2022-09-15T17:15:20.000Z.    virtualization-type - The virtualization type of the instance (paravirtual | hvm).    vpc-id - The ID of the VPC that the instance is running in.

If you are creating a block device mapping for a new (empty) volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true for an encrypted volume, or false for an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to false (unencrypted).   If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot, you must omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify.   If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing unencrypted volume, you can include this parameter, but you must specify false. If you specify true, the request will fail. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter.   If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true or false. However, if you specify false, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is always encrypted. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter.

This means that we will request Spot Instances from the pools that we believe have the lowest chance of interruption in the near term. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use capacityOptimizedPrioritized. Set a priority for each instance type by using the Priority parameter for LaunchTemplateOverrides.

If a pool runs out of capacity before fulfilling your desired capacity, Spot Fleet will continue to fulfill your request by drawing from the next lowest priced pool.
