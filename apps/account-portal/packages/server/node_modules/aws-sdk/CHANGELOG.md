In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, you can choose to promote a Read Replica to become standalone a DB instance when needed.Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.You can now combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. Since Read Replicas can also be created in different regions than the source database, your Read Replica can be promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.For more information, see the Amazon RDS User Guide.

Once cataloged, your data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available for ETL. AWS Glue generates the code to execute your data transformations and data loading processes. AWS Glue generates Python code that is entirely customizable, reusable, and portable. Once your ETL job is ready, you can schedule it to run on AWS Glue's fully managed, scale-out Spark environment. AWS Glue provides a flexible scheduler with dependency resolution, job monitoring, and alerting. AWS Glue is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to buy, set up, or manage. It automatically provisions the environment needed to complete the job, and customers pay only for the compute resources consumed while running ETL jobs. With AWS Glue, data can be available for analytics in minutes.
* feature: MigrationHub: AWS Migration Hub provides a single location to track migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions.

For example, you might use AWS Database Migration Service, AWS Server Migration Service, and partner migration tools to migrate an application comprised of a database, virtualized web servers, and a bare metal server. Using Migration Hub will provide you with a single screen that shows the migration progress of all the resources in the application. This allows you to quickly get progress updates across all of your migrations, easily identify and troubleshoot any issues, and reduce the overall time and effort spent on your migration projects. Migration Hub is available to all AWS customers at no additional charge. You only pay for the cost of the migration tools you use, and any resources being consumed on AWS.
