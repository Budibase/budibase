 * was ever needed. Therefore we need to support old apps which may still have
 * the manifest at this location for the first update.
 *
 * The new paths for the in-use version are:
 * {appId}/manifest.json
 * {appId}/budibase-client.js
 *
 * The paths for the backups are:
 * {appId}/manifest.json.bak
 * {appId}/budibase-client.js.bak
 *
 * We don't rely on NPM at all any more, as when updating to the latest version
 * we pull both the manifest and client bundle from the server's dependencies
 * in the local file system.
