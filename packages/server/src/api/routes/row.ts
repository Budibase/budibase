   * @apiDescription This is the primary method of accessing rows in Budibase, the data provider

   * handled through this, for internal and external (datasource plus, e.g. SQL) tables.
   *
   * @apiParam {string} tableId The ID of the table to retrieve rows from.
   *
   * @apiParam (Body) {boolean} [paginate] If pagination is required then this should be set to true,
   * defaults to false.
   * @apiParam (Body) {object} [query] This contains a set of filters which should be applied, if none
   * specified then the request will be unfiltered. An example with all of the possible query
   * options has been supplied below.
   * @apiParam (Body) {number} [limit] This sets a limit for the number of rows that will be returned,
   * this will be implemented at the database level if supported for performance reasons. This
   * is useful when paginating to set exactly how many rows per page.
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} [bookmark] If pagination is enabled then a bookmark will be returned
   * with each successful search request, this should be supplied back to get the next page.
   * @apiParam (Body) {object} [sort] If sort is desired this should contain the name of the column to
   * sort on.
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} [sortOrder] If sort is enabled then this can be either "descending" or
   * "ascending" as required.
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} [sortType] If sort is enabled then you must specify the type of search
   * being used, either "string" or "number". This is only used for internal tables.
   *
   * @apiParamExample {json} Example:
   * {
   *  "tableId": "ta_70260ff0b85c467ca74364aefc46f26d",

   *  "sortOrder": "descending",
   *  "sortType": "string",

   *
   * @apiSuccess {object[]} rows An array of rows that was found based on the supplied parameters.

   * not there is another page after this request.
   * @apiSuccess {string} bookmark The bookmark to be sent with the next request to get the next
