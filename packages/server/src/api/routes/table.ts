   * @apiDescription Create or update a table with this endpoint, this will function for both internal
   * external tables.
   *
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} [_id] If updating an existing table then the ID of the table must be specified.
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} [_rev] If updating an existing internal table then the revision must also be specified.
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} type] This should either be "internal" or "external" depending on the table type -
   * this will default to internal.
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} [sourceId] If creating an external table then this should be set to the datasource ID. If
   * building an internal table this does not need to be set, although it will be returned as "bb_internal".
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} name The name of the table, this will be used in the UI. To rename the table simply
   * supply the table structure to this endpoint with the name changed.
   * @apiParam (Body) {object} schema A key value object which has all of the columns in the table as the keys in this
   * object. For each column a "type" and "constraints" must be specified, with some types requiring further information.
   * More information about the schema structure can be found in the Typescript definitions.
   * @apiParam (Body) {string} [primaryDisplay] The name of the column which should be used when displaying rows
   * from this table as relationships.
   * @apiParam (Body) {object[]} [indexes] Specifies the search indexes - this is deprecated behaviour with the introduction
   * of lucene indexes. This functionality is only available for internal tables.
   * @apiParam (Body) {object} [_rename] If a column is to be renamed then the "old" column name should be set in this
   * structure, and the "updated", new column name should also be supplied. The schema should also be updated, this field
   * lets the server know that a field hasn't just been deleted, that the data has moved to a new name, this will fix
   * the rows in the table. This functionality is only available for internal tables.
   * @apiParam (Body) {object} [dataImport] When creating an internal table it can be built from a CSV, by using the
   * CSV validation endpoint. Send the CSV data to the validation endpoint, then put the results of that call
   * into this property, along with the CSV and a table/rows will be built from it. This is not supported when updating
   * or for external tables.
