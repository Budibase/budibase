#### p.S...

I am using contribution guidelines from the fantastic [ZeroMQ](https://github.com/zeromq) community. If you are interested why, it's because I believe in the ethos laid out by this community, and written about in depth in the book ["Social Architecture"](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Architecture-Building-line-Communities/dp/1533112452) by Pieter Hintjens. 

I am very much open to evolving this to suit our needs.

Love from [Mike](https://github.com/mikebudi).
