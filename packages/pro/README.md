# Budibase Pro

Welcome to Budibase Pro. This repo is the home for closed source Budibase features and also the integration point for all things licensing.

This repo acts as a library and is shared between Budibase and the Account Portal.
For a general overview of the pro package see the [licensing documentation](https://budibase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/26050577/budibase+pro+package) on confluence.

For anything else related to local development see the [docs](./docs/readme.md)
