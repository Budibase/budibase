## Prerequisites

- `helm` v3 or above
- Kubernetes 1.4+
- A storage controller (if you want to use persistent storage)
- An ingress controller (if you want to define an `Ingress` resource)
- `metrics-server` (if you want to make use of horizontal pod autoscaling)

## Chart dependencies

This chart depends on the official Apache CouchDB chart. You can see its
documentation here:
<https://github.com/apache/couchdb-helm/tree/couchdb-4.3.0/couchdb>.

## Upgrading

### `2.x` to `3.0.0`

We made a number of breaking changes in this release to make the chart more
idiomatic and easier to use.

1. We no longer bundle `ingress-nginx`. If you were relying on this to supply
   an ingress controller to your cluster, you will now need to deploy that
   separately. You'll find guidance for that here:
   <https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/>.
2. We've upgraded the version of the [CouchDB chart](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-helm)
   we use from `3.3.4` to `4.3.0`. The primary motivation for this was to align
   the CouchDB chart used with the CouchDB version used, which has also updated
   from 3.1.1 to 3.2.1. Additionally, we're moving away from the official CouchDB
   to one we're building ourselves.
3. We've separated out the supplied AWS ALB ingress resource for those deploying
   into EKS. Where previously you enabled this by setting `ingress.enabled: false`
   and `ingress.aws: true`, you now set `awsAlbIngress.enabled: true` and all
   configuration for it is under `awsAlbIngress`.
4. The `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` that was configured at `hpa.enabled: true` has
   been split into 3 separate HPAs, one for each of `apps`, `worker`, and `proxy`.
   They are configured at `services.{apps,worker,proxy}.autoscaling`.

## Installing

To install the chart from our repository:

```console
$ helm repo add budibase https://budibase.github.io/budibase/
$ helm repo update
$ helm install --create-namespace --namespace budibase budibase budibase/budibase
```

To install the chart from this repo:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:budibase/budibase.git
$ cd budibase/charts/budibase
$ helm install --create-namespace --namespace budibase budibase .
```

## Example minimal configuration

Here's an example `values.yaml` that would get a Budibase instance running in a home
cluster using an nginx ingress controller and NFS as cluster storage (basically one of our
staff's homelabs).

<details>

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "nginx"
  hosts:
    - host: budibase.local # set this to whatever DNS name you'd use
      paths:
        - backend:
            service:
              name: proxy-service
              port:
                number: 10000
          path: /
          pathType: Prefix

couchdb:
  persistentVolume:
    enabled: true
    storageClass: "nfs-client"
  adminPassword: admin

  objectStore:
    storageClass: "nfs-client"
  redis:
    storageClass: "nfs-client"
```

If you wanted to use this when bringing up Budibase in your own cluster, you could save it
to your hard disk and run the following:

```console
$ helm install --create-namespace --namespace budibase budibase . -f values.yaml
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall the chart, assuming you named the release `budibase` (both commands in the installation section do so):

```console
$ helm uninstall --namespace budibase budibase
```
